# Vehicles store

## Clone repo
`$ git clone git@github.com:jameeleg/vehicles-store.git`


## Production
```
cd vehicles-store
npm install
cd client
npm install
cd ..
npm start
```
Then go to http://localhost:3080



If you want a development environment, then you need to build the node server, and development server for angular.

## Development server node
Run the following commands:

```
$ cd vehicles-store
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## Development server for client
Navigate back to the root directory, then run the following commands:

```
$ cd vehicles-store/client
$ npm install
$ ng serve
```

After a short while you should see the following message:

```Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/```


Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`, register, select your vehicle and place your order.


Happy "vehicling" :)
